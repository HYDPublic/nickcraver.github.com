          <h1>Stack Overflow Developer Desktop Build - 2016</h1>
          <p>One of the things we're big on at Stack Exchange is hardware - we love it. More importantly, we love <i>not waiting on it</i>. 
            With that in mind, we upgrade our developer machines every 2 years. In case it helps anyone else, I'm posting our current parts list here.
            This isn't set in stone, we review and update it to the latest tech every time we build a machine. We also customize the build for each developer if needed - for example those needing extra space or specific display connections, etc. I'll try and keep this page updated as we make changes.
          </p>
          <p>If you're wondering about laptops: yes, we use those too. You can buy what you want to work with. Most prefer a beefy desktop and a laptop to remote in, or switch their desktop and laptop refreshes every 2 years (alternating what they spend most on). Some just want the beefiest laptop they can get. Laptops are mostly <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">Retina MacBook Pros</a> (16GB RAM, 1TB Drives, max procs). Not all laptops are rMBPs though, some prefer a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> or an <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-systems/razer-blade">Razer Blade</a>...or something else entirely.
          </p>
          <p>Monitors are not on here because they're usually a separate purchase rarely made at the same time. Most of our developers use 3x 30" <a href="https://amzn.to/2frWkCZ">Dell UP3017s</a> (whatever the current 30" model is), but this also varies widely. Some prefer the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-34UM95-34-Inch-LED-Lit/dp/B00JR6GCZA">LG 34" 21:9 UM95 widescreens</a> for example. Lately, 4K and 5K are becoming more common. We're hoping some single-cable 5K monitors (DisplayPort 1.3+) start arriving, then they'll be practical too - right now they're a connectivity issue. Keyboards &amp; mice are much more varied - the <a href="https://amzn.to/2fuYIfD">CODE keyboard</a> quite a few devs use (yeah, we all have various switches) but everything is very much personal choice for looks, ergonomics, etc.</p>
          <p>Make special note of the memory here. DDR4 is still changing, and it's shifting with every build we do. For the big memory users (VMs, SQL, redis clusters, machine learning, etc.), we are going with a 128GB setup. For lighter workloads, we may only get 64GB since it's so easy to add another 64GB later. Why do we get 128GB? Because for under $250 more, if you need more than 64GB it's <i>so cheap</i> compared to anything else to increase productivity. It's a very easy barrier to buy your way out of.</p>

                    We don't get the i7-6950X because though it has 10 cores, they are clocked lower and the price increase is crazy. You're much better off with a Xeon v4 in that range.

                    High-end because driving 3 monitors isn't trivial. Additionally, we do tag engine processing on the GPU, so developers working on this code need a current CUDA GPU.
